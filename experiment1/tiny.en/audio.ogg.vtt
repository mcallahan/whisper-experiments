00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
I can't believe we've got to stop with the truth, I can't believe we've got to stop with the truth.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
If I have to hear the latter name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill it.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Relax, Sugarbun. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Where are you, man?

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Come on, team. We mustn't tell you, Dally, when there's so much nature to see.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
I was thinking, we should call our class project fun guys that are forest.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Shush, nothing no one to. And she's in distress.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
There, then we need two motors in a flower.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
So, look at your goo.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Wow. Out of the way, talk what? We're camping here.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Finally, time to get that barbecue burning.

01:18.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh, oh dear.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
A piss break!

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Bam, damn it.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, bam, bam.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Boy, fungus free, make yourself useful and fix the ten.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
They've been to friendly campsite ribbing.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Fun.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Ah, she went to five five minutes alone in these woods.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Oh, yeah. She's a real weeny that one in it.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Boy, Phil. Ah, no sausage is coming.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Almost ready.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
We're going to need a bit more show.

02:05.000 --> 02:22.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:22.000 --> 02:37.000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Where are we wrong?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I wonder what kind of species.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Bloody hell with those things.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
It's like a no-shaper mushroom.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Don't bring us up to the day of fun

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Bring me up, yay, yay, yay

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Bring me to the classroom where we run

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Yay, we're absolutely adorable

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
We'd be famous

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Get on MTV

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I wonder what they taste like

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
We really shouldn't disrupt their habitat

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Right

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Sure

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Sure

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Greatings

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Welcome friends

I'll be right down

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
It's good I interest you in some peppermint tea

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
What are you guys?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
We are sprayed

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
We spray balanced to the forest

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
We take care of the animals

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Plants

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000

Hey, a little mushroom geezer

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You call with us camping here for the night?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Absolutely

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

04:03.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Guys

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000

Oh, ah!

06:48.680 --> 07:11.260
Rally,

I don't want to hurt you, just keep your distance!

07:16.260 --> 07:20.260
Alright then, it's all too little green faucets!

07:47.260 --> 07:48.260
Ah!

07:58.260 --> 08:03.260
Those punks treated the world as a long personal rubbish bin!

08:03.260 --> 08:05.260
And you won't set them free!

08:05.260 --> 08:11.260
Now you're join them!

08:35.260 --> 08:49.260
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

08:49.260 --> 08:51.260
Alright, sprites!

08:51.260 --> 08:55.260

09:11.260 --> 09:13.260
Drink the eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye!

09:13.260 --> 09:14.260
Dang it, danger!

09:14.260 --> 09:17.260
I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way!

09:17.260 --> 09:20.260
I'm about to blast it, stick right plastic!

09:20.260 --> 09:22.260
What am I gonna say?

09:22.260 --> 09:25.260
Whoa!

09:41.260 --> 09:42.260
Whoa, a little deerie!

09:42.260 --> 09:43.260
They call me cavalry!

09:43.260 --> 09:45.260
Try to cut me down two sides!

09:45.260 --> 09:47.260
Look at this, my announcer driver!

09:47.260 --> 09:49.260
About to pick me cakes and thighs!

09:49.260 --> 09:51.260

09:51.260 --> 09:54.260
You come to follow me and my crew, don't they?

My peers on the log, I know they've found their files,

09:57.260 --> 09:59.260
cut walls in the tree to set!

09:59.260 --> 10:00.260
Hey, hey!

10:08.260 --> 10:19.260
It's a hero!
