< Hello, Mr.Snail!
< Aw, you cute little cornu aspersum.
< Latin name bonus-points!
< Can’t believe we got stuck with the tree hugger.
< If I have to hear the latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.
< Relax, Sugar Buns. While she does all the work we’ll have all the fun.
< Yeah! And get wasted out of our minds!
< Way ahead of you, man.
< C’mon, team! We mustn’t dilly-dally when there’s so much nature to see!

< Yeah. She's a real weenie that one, innit?
< Oy, Phil! How those sausages coming?
< Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt...
< It's incredible. It's a new species.
< What the bloody hell are those things?
< It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom.
< They’re absolutely adorable.
< Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.
< And I bet we’ll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.
< We'd be famous!
< Get on MTV.
< I wonder what they taste like.
< We really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.
< Right. Sure, sure.
< Greetings.
< Welcome, friends.
< I'll be right down.
< Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?
