1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't believe we've got to stop with the truth, I can't believe we've got to stop with the truth.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I have to hear the latter name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill it.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Relax, Sugarbun. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Where are you, man?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on, team. We mustn't tell you, Dally, when there's so much nature to see.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was thinking, we should call our class project fun guys that are forest.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Shush, nothing no one to. And she's in distress.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There, then we need two motors in a flower.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, look at your goo.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wow. Out of the way, talk what? We're camping here.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Finally, time to get that barbecue burning.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, oh dear.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
A piss break!

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Bam, damn it.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, bam, bam.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Boy, fungus free, make yourself useful and fix the ten.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They've been to friendly campsite ribbing.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fun.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Ah, she went to five five minutes alone in these woods.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, yeah. She's a real weeny that one in it.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Boy, Phil. Ah, no sausage is coming.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Almost ready.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We're going to need a bit more show.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Where are we wrong?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I wonder what kind of species.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Bloody hell with those things.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's like a no-shaper mushroom.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't bring us up to the day of fun

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bring me up, yay, yay, yay

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Bring me to the classroom where we run

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yay, we're absolutely adorable

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'd be famous

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Get on MTV

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I wonder what they taste like

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We really shouldn't disrupt their habitat

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sure

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Greatings

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Welcome friends

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll be right down

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's good I interest you in some peppermint tea

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you guys?

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We are sprayed

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We spray balanced to the forest

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We take care of the animals

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Plants

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Plants

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Guys

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Huh?

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey, a little mushroom geezer

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You call with us camping here for the night?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Absolutely

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Guys

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Guys

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Guys, this isn't funny

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Nice

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We're just going to catch one

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But they're psycho

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You pick the wrong camping spot bitches

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Spray time

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000

So on

We mini

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
WeECH

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We are

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh!

She has a wife now, baby!

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh!

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000

Oh, get it off!

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sweet face!

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, no!

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, no, no!

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh!

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000

Oh!

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh!

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh!

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's not!

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No!

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh!

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's not!

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's not!

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No!

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No!

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh!

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, it's not!

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I got a swim!

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I got a swim!

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, it's weird!

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, oh!

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Oh, ah!

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:07:11,260
Rally,

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,260
I don't want to hurt you, just keep your distance!

146
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Alright then, it's all too little green faucets!

147
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Ah!

148
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Those punks treated the world as a long personal rubbish bin!

149
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
And you won't set them free!

150
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Now you're join them!

151
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:49,260
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

152
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
Alright, sprites!

153
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

154
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:02,260
Giving us where every road can I be, I believe, before it's still so happy!

155
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Oh, oh, ha ha!

156
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Be all together now!

157
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Spread these friends with the sun!

158
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Drink these friends with the sun!

159
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Drink these friends with the moon!

160
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
We will suck to the day as well!

161
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
Drink the eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye!

162
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
Dang it, danger!

163
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,260
I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way!

164
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm about to blast it, stick right plastic!

165
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
What am I gonna say?

166
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Whoa!

167
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,260
The drop is stanky, drop it!

168
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
I'ma just catch and scream!

169
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,260
Now pillage and move it!

170
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
I'm up all loaded!

171
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
Link to the river to the stream!

172
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
What's up?

173
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,260
Whoa, a little deerie!

174
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
They call me cavalry!

175
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
Try to cut me down two sides!

176
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Look at this, my announcer driver!

177
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
About to pick me cakes and thighs!

178
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Yeah, this camp is a cannot!

179
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,260
You come to follow me and my crew, don't they?

180
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,260
My peers on the log, I know they've found their files,

181
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
cut walls in the tree to set!

182
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,260
Hey, hey!

183
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,260
It's a hero!

184
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,260
It's a hero!

185
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
It's a hero!

186
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
It's a hero!

187
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
It's a hero!

188
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:19,260
It's a hero!
