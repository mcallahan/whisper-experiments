00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, Mr. Snail!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh, you cute little corny-ass person!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That name, bonus points!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a trick!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, no, Mr. Snail!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, you cute little corny-ass person!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That name, bonus points!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a trick!

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I have to hear the latter name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill him!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Relax, sugar buns!

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Where are you, man?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on, team! We mustn't dilly dally when there's so much nature to see!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I was thinking, we should call our class project, fun guys and a forest!

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Get it?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Shush!

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's the no-what team!

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And she's into stress!

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There's a little mountain of lava!

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, look at your goo!

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wow!

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Out of the way, talk what?

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're camping here!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Finally!

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's time to get that barbecue, Bernie!

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, oh, oh, dude!

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ah!

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ah!

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ah!

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh!

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And easy guys, was supposed to be studying nature and not wrecking it!

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh!

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Piss!

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, damn it!

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oi! Fungus Freak!

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Make yourself useful and fix the tent!

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A bit of friendly campsite ribbing!

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She went to five, five minutes alone in these woods.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh yeah, she's a real weenie that one in it.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oi, Phil.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ah, no sausages coming.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Almost ready.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She did a bit more so.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What a bloody hell with those things.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's like a no-shack to mushroom.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, absolutely adorable.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'll be famous.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Get on MTV.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I wonder what they taste like.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's rock the habitat.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sure, sure.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Greetings.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Welcome, friends.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll be right down.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Could I interest you in some pepperminty?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you guys?

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We are Sprites.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We Sprite balanced to the forest.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We take care of the animals.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What?

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Guys, guys.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey, a little mushroom gaza.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You call with us camping here for the night?

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Absolutely.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A friend of the forest is a friend of the Sprites.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Guys.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Guys.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Guys, this isn't funny.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Guys.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We're just going to catch one.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But they're psycho.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You've got to get me out of these hurry.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sprite me go.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hurry up.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wait for me.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sprite time.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sprite.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sprite.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sprite.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Fresh air.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sprite.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sprite.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Sprite.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sprite.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sprite.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sprite.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sprite.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sprite.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sprite.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, no!

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh!

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No!

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No!

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No!

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
She had to wipe her open!

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh!

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh!

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No!

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No!

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No!

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We're safe!

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No!

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No!

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No!

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No!

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No!

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh!

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Huh?

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No!

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
No!

120
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Hey, hey, hey!

121
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Hey, hey!

122
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm going to destroy this community!

123
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
No!

124
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
No!

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
No!

126
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
No!

127
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
No!

128
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
No!

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
No!

130
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
It's insane!

131
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
No!

132
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
No!

133
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
It's insane!

134
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
NO!

135
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
No!

136
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
It's not!

137
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
No!

138
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
No!

139
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
No!

140
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
No!

141
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
No!

142
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
No, no!

143
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I can't!

144
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
No!

145
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I can't.

146
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
No!

147
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,680
Help!

148
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,580
Help!

149
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,600
Help!

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,840
Hello!

151
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,680
Open the door!

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,980
Open the door!

153
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,260
Open the door!

154
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,760
Open the door!

155
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
He's no distance!

156
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,760
All right then, it's all too little green fastest!

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Oh!

158
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,760
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin!

159
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
And you won't set them free!

160
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Now you'll join them!

161
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,760
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

162
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:54,760
All right, Sprite, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Giving us where every wrong daddy, daddy Billy, before his tears are happy home!

164
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Sprite, Sprite, Sprite's with the sun!

165
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Sprite, Sprite, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

166
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger about and clear the way!

167
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm about to blast this stick like plastic, what am I gonna say?

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm about to drop it, stanky, drop it!

169
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
I'm about to just catch you in steam!

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
Now pillage and need it, I'm about to loot it!

171
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Lake to the river to the stream, we'll spawn!

172
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm a little dearie, and call me Cavalry!

173
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
Try to cut me down to size!

174
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Look at these, my announcer, driver!

175
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Bouncer, bakein' me cakes and pies!

176
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Yeah, this camp is a collapse, you come to fall out!

177
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
Me and my crew don't dare!

178
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
My crew's on the log, and they'll link from the file cut!

179
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Wars and the truth, you sick!

180
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Hey, hey, hey!

181
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Get it, get it, get it wrong!

182
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Get it, get it wrong!

183
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Get it, get it, get it wrong!

184
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Take it, run, run!
