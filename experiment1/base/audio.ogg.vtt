00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hello, Mr. Snail!

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Oh, you cute little corny-ass person!

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
That name, bonus points!

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a trick!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, no, Mr. Snail!

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh, you cute little corny-ass person!

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
That name, bonus points!

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a trick!

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger!

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
If I have to hear the latter name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill him!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Relax, sugar buns!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun!

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds!

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Where are you, man?

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Come on, team! We mustn't dilly dally when there's so much nature to see!

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I was thinking, we should call our class project, fun guys and a forest!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Get it?

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys!

00:58.000 --> 00:58.000
Shush!

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
That's the no-what team!

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And she's into stress!

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
There's a little mountain of lava!

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
Oh, look at your goo!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Wow!

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Out of the way, talk what?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
We're camping here!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Finally!

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
It's time to get that barbecue, Bernie!

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, oh, oh, dude!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Ah!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Ah!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Ah!

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh!

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
And easy guys, was supposed to be studying nature and not wrecking it!

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Oh!

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Piss!

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, damn it!

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Oi! Fungus Freak!

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Make yourself useful and fix the tent!

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
A bit of friendly campsite ribbing!

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
She went to five, five minutes alone in these woods.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh yeah, she's a real weenie that one in it.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Oi, Phil.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Ah, no sausages coming.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Almost ready.

02:01.000 --> 02:27.000
She did a bit more so.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
What a bloody hell with those things.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
It's like a no-shack to mushroom.

02:43.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, absolutely adorable.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
We'll be famous.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Get on MTV.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I wonder what they taste like.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Let's rock the habitat.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Right.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Sure, sure.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Greetings.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Welcome, friends.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I'll be right down.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
Could I interest you in some pepperminty?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
What are you guys?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
We are Sprites.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
We Sprite balanced to the forest.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
We take care of the animals.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
What?

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Guys, guys.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Hey, a little mushroom gaza.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
You call with us camping here for the night?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Absolutely.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
A friend of the forest is a friend of the Sprites.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Guys.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Guys.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Guys, this isn't funny.

04:25.000 --> 04:35.000
Guys.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
We're just going to catch one.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
But they're psycho.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You've got to get me out of these hurry.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Sprite me go.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Hurry up.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Wait for me.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Sprite time.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Sprite.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Sprite.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Sprite.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Fresh air.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Sprite.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Sprite.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Sprite.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Sprite.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Sprite.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Sprite.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Sprite.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Sprite.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Sprite.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh, no!

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
No!

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
No!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No!

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
She had to wipe her open!

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
No!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
No!

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
No!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
We're safe!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
No!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
No!

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
No!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
No!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
No!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Huh?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
No!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.500
No!

06:20.500 --> 06:20.500
Hey, hey, hey!

06:20.500 --> 06:21.500
Hey, hey!

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
I'm going to destroy this community!

06:22.500 --> 06:24.500
No!

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
No!

06:25.500 --> 06:26.500
No!

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
No!

06:27.500 --> 06:28.500
No!

06:28.500 --> 06:29.500
No!

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
No!

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
It's insane!

06:29.500 --> 06:30.500
No!

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
No!

06:31.500 --> 06:32.500
It's insane!

06:32.500 --> 06:33.500
NO!

06:33.500 --> 06:34.500
No!

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
It's not!

06:35.500 --> 06:36.500
No!

06:36.500 --> 06:37.500
No!

06:37.500 --> 06:38.500
No!

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
No!

06:39.500 --> 06:40.500
No!

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
No, no!

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
I can't!

06:42.500 --> 06:43.500
No!

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
I can't.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
No!

06:45.500 --> 06:46.680
Help!

06:46.680 --> 06:49.580
Help!

06:49.580 --> 06:50.600
Help!

07:04.000 --> 07:08.840
Hello!

07:08.840 --> 07:11.680
Open the door!

07:11.680 --> 07:12.980
Open the door!

07:12.980 --> 07:13.260
Open the door!

07:13.260 --> 07:14.760
Open the door!

07:14.760 --> 07:15.760
He's no distance!

07:15.760 --> 07:20.760
All right then, it's all too little green fastest!

07:45.760 --> 07:47.760
Oh!

07:57.760 --> 08:02.760
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin!

08:02.760 --> 08:04.760
And you won't set them free!

08:04.760 --> 08:15.760
Now you'll join them!

08:34.760 --> 08:41.760
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

08:41.760 --> 08:54.760
All right, Sprite, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

08:54.760 --> 09:04.760
Giving us where every wrong daddy, daddy Billy, before his tears are happy home!

09:04.760 --> 09:07.760
Sprite, Sprite, Sprite's with the sun!

09:07.760 --> 09:13.760
Sprite, Sprite, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

09:13.760 --> 09:17.760
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger about and clear the way!

09:17.760 --> 09:22.760
I'm about to blast this stick like plastic, what am I gonna say?

09:22.760 --> 09:25.760
I'm about to drop it, stanky, drop it!

09:25.760 --> 09:27.760
I'm about to just catch you in steam!

09:27.760 --> 09:29.760
Now pillage and need it, I'm about to loot it!

09:29.760 --> 09:32.760
Lake to the river to the stream, we'll spawn!

09:40.760 --> 09:43.760
I'm a little dearie, and call me Cavalry!

09:43.760 --> 09:45.760
Try to cut me down to size!

09:45.760 --> 09:47.760
Look at these, my announcer, driver!

09:47.760 --> 09:49.760
Bouncer, bakein' me cakes and pies!

09:49.760 --> 09:52.760
Yeah, this camp is a collapse, you come to fall out!

09:52.760 --> 09:54.760
Me and my crew don't dare!

09:54.760 --> 09:56.760
My crew's on the log, and they'll link from the file cut!

09:56.760 --> 09:58.760
Wars and the truth, you sick!

09:58.760 --> 09:59.760
Hey, hey, hey!

09:59.760 --> 10:01.760
Get it, get it, get it wrong!

10:01.760 --> 10:03.760
Get it, get it wrong!

10:03.760 --> 10:05.760
Get it, get it, get it wrong!

10:05.760 --> 10:19.760
Take it, run, run!
