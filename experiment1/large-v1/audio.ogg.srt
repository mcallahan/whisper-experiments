00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello, Mr. Snail. Oh, you cute, little, corn-ewisper-some. Latin name. Bonus points.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger. If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Relax, sugar buns. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Way ahead of you, man.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on, team. We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I was thinking we should call our class project Fungi's in a Forest. Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Shush! That's a low word, team. And she's in distress. There, there, my little Monticello flower.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, look at her go. Wow.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Out of the way, dorkwad. We're camping here.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Finally. Time to get that barbecue burning.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, oh dear.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Gross.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Easy, guys. We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Piss break.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, dear.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oi, fungus freak. Make yourself usable and fix the tent.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oi, Phil. I know sausage is coming.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Almost ready. Just need a bit more salt.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's incredible. It's a new species.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What the bloody hell are those things? It's like a no shagged a mushroom.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Friendly bees, friendly gums. We won't stop till the day is fun.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Friendly yi yi yi yum yum. We can watch wherever we run.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Friendly bees, friendly gums.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They're absolutely adorable. Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We'll be famous. Get on MTV. I wonder what they taste like.

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sure, sure.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Greetings. Welcome, friends. I'll be right down.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you guys?

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We are Sprites. We sprite balance to the forest.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We take care of the animals. Squants, birds, moths, baby bugs.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Guys, guys.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey, little mushroom geezer. You cool with us camping here for the night?

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the Sprites.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe, maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Guys?

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Guys?

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Guys, this isn't funny.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Guys?

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Guys?

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They've got to get me out of these hurry. They're going to kill us.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sprite, we go.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hurry.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They've been left for leaf and stone.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sprite time.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You little freaks.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sprite this.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Help, my heart.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you okay?

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sprite, help me.

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sugarbunch, Sugarbunch, help me.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Help me.

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Help me.

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sweet cake.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, stop it.

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is that?

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, no, no.

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't swim.

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't swim.

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, yes.

70
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No, no.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Sugarbunch, Sprite's here.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Surprise.

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't want to hurt you. Just keep your distance.

74
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right then.

75
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Eat salty little green bastards.

76
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin and you set them free.

77
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now you'll join them.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll give you that one, Brother Bird.

79
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right, Sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

80
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm giving lunch where ever we roam. Die-dee, die-dee, Billy, the forest is our happy home. Pull, pull, ha-ha, we all together now.

81
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Stride, loose, Sprite, Sprite, slick the sun. Strang-dee-dee, Strang-dee-dum. We won't stop till the day is fun.

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Strang-dee, yi-yi-yi, yum-yum.

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger. Up out and clear the way.

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm about to blast this dick like plastic. What your mama gonna say?

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it. I'ma just catch in steam.

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Now pillage and loot it. I'ma pollute it. Lake to the river, to the stream, posposh.

87
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Pull a little deerie and call me Cavalierie. Try to cut me down to size.

88
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, baking me cakes and pies.

89
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, this camp is a call-out. Here come the fallout. Me and my crew don't play.

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
My blues on the log, on the leaf, on the frog. Cut words in the tree to say, hey, hey, hey.

91
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:21,000
City get rough, city get rough. City get rough, city get rough.
