00:00.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello, Mr. Snail. Oh, you cute, little, corn-ewisper-some. Latin name. Bonus points.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
Can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger. If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Relax, sugar buns. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Way ahead of you, man.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Come on, team. We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

00:48.000 --> 00:57.000
I was thinking we should call our class project Fungi's in a Forest. Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
Shush! That's a low word, team. And she's in distress. There, there, my little Monticello flower.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, look at her go. Wow.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Out of the way, dorkwad. We're camping here.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Finally. Time to get that barbecue burning.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, oh dear.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Gross.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Easy, guys. We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Piss break.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh, dear.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Oi, fungus freak. Make yourself usable and fix the tent.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Oi, Phil. I know sausage is coming.

01:59.000 --> 02:07.000
Almost ready. Just need a bit more salt.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.000
It's incredible. It's a new species.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
What the bloody hell are those things? It's like a no shagged a mushroom.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Friendly bees, friendly gums. We won't stop till the day is fun.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Friendly yi yi yi yum yum. We can watch wherever we run.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Friendly bees, friendly gums.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
They're absolutely adorable. Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
We'll be famous. Get on MTV. I wonder what they taste like.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Sure, sure.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.000
Greetings. Welcome, friends. I'll be right down.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
What are you guys?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
We are Sprites. We sprite balance to the forest.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
We take care of the animals. Squants, birds, moths, baby bugs.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Guys, guys.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
Hey, little mushroom geezer. You cool with us camping here for the night?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the Sprites.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe, maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Guys?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Guys?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Guys, this isn't funny.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Guys?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Guys?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
They've got to get me out of these hurry. They're going to kill us.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Sprite, we go.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Hurry.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
They've been left for leaf and stone.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Sprite time.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You little freaks.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Sprite this.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Help, my heart.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Are you okay?

05:34.000 --> 05:51.000
Sprite, help me.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Sugarbunch, Sugarbunch, help me.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Help me.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Help me.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Sweet cake.

06:09.000 --> 06:33.000
No, stop it.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
What?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Is that?

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
No, no, no.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I can't swim.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I can't swim.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Yes, yes.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
No, no.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Sugarbunch, Sprite's here.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Surprise.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't want to hurt you. Just keep your distance.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
All right then.

07:18.000 --> 07:46.000
Eat salty little green bastards.

07:48.000 --> 08:05.000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin and you set them free.

08:05.000 --> 08:33.000
Now you'll join them.

08:35.000 --> 08:49.000
I'll give you that one, Brother Bird.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
All right, Sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

08:55.000 --> 09:05.000
I'm giving lunch where ever we roam. Die-dee, die-dee, Billy, the forest is our happy home. Pull, pull, ha-ha, we all together now.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
Stride, loose, Sprite, Sprite, slick the sun. Strang-dee-dee, Strang-dee-dum. We won't stop till the day is fun.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Strang-dee, yi-yi-yi, yum-yum.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger. Up out and clear the way.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
I'm about to blast this dick like plastic. What your mama gonna say?

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it. I'ma just catch in steam.

09:27.000 --> 09:40.000
Now pillage and loot it. I'ma pollute it. Lake to the river, to the stream, posposh.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
Pull a little deerie and call me Cavalierie. Try to cut me down to size.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Well, there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, baking me cakes and pies.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, this camp is a call-out. Here come the fallout. Me and my crew don't play.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
My blues on the log, on the leaf, on the frog. Cut words in the tree to say, hey, hey, hey.

10:00.000 --> 10:21.000
City get rough, city get rough. City get rough, city get rough.
