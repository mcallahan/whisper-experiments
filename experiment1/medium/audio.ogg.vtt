00:00.000 --> 00:19.240
Oh, you cute little corny little sparsome.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.240
Blatanty.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
Bonus points.

00:21.240 --> 00:30.840
Ugh, can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.760
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill her.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.280
Relax sugar puns, while she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:39.280 --> 00:42.560
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.560
Way ahead of you, man.

00:43.560 --> 00:48.560
Come on team, we mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.560
I was thinking, we should call our class project Fun Guys in a Forest.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.560
Get it?

00:53.560 --> 00:57.560
Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.560
Shush!

00:58.560 --> 01:01.560
That's a low-wage tale, and she's in distress.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.560
There they are, my little Montesilaf larva.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.560
Oh, look at her go.

01:08.560 --> 01:09.560
Wow.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.560
Out of the way, dork-wad.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.560
We're camping here.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.560
Finally.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.560
Time to get that barbecue burning.

01:17.560 --> 01:19.560
Oh, oh dear.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.560
Gross.

01:30.560 --> 01:35.560
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.560
Piss break.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.560
Oi, fungus freak, make yourself useful and fix the tent.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.560
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.560
Fun.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.560
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.560
Yeah, she's a real weenie that one, innit?

01:56.560 --> 01:58.560
Oi, Phil, our new sausage is coming.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.560
Almost ready.

02:00.560 --> 02:28.560
We just need a bit more salt.

02:28.560 --> 02:38.560
Incredible, it's a new species.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.560
What the bloody hell are those things?

02:41.560 --> 02:43.560
It's like a note shagged a mushroom.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.560
They're absolutely adorable.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.560
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.560
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
We'd be famous.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.560
Get on MTV.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.560
I wonder what they taste like.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.560
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
Right.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.560
Should we?

03:01.560 --> 03:02.560
We should.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.560
We should.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
We should.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.560
We should.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
We should.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.560
We should.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.560
We should.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.560
We should.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.560
Right, sure, sure.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
Greetings.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.560
Welcome, friends.

03:18.560 --> 03:24.560
I'll be right down.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.560
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:28.560 --> 03:30.560
What are you guys?

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
We're sprites.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.560
We sprite balance to the forest.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.800
Take care of the animals.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.600
Squants, birds, swans, ladybugs.

03:38.600 --> 03:46.680
Squirrels, bees, squirrels, a small, small species of grass.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.840
Hey, little mushroom geezer, you call with us

03:49.840 --> 03:51.480
camping here for the night?

03:51.480 --> 03:52.800
Absolutely.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.640
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

03:57.640 --> 04:03.440
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.800
Yeah, maybe they were just painting

04:05.800 --> 04:07.800
their little hats or something.

04:15.480 --> 04:15.960
Guys?

04:19.960 --> 04:22.320
Guys?

04:22.320 --> 04:25.240
Guys, this isn't funny.

04:25.240 --> 04:33.400
Guys?

04:47.400 --> 04:50.000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.520
They've got to get me out of these hurry.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.440
They've got to kill us.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.440
Hurry.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.320
Wait for the F for leaf and stone.

04:59.320 --> 05:03.440
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.920
Spray them!

05:04.920 --> 05:05.920
Run!

05:05.920 --> 05:14.840
You little freaks!

05:14.840 --> 05:22.000
Spray this!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah!

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh my God!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh my God!

05:35.000 --> 05:57.000
Oh my God!

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Sugarman! Sugarman, help me!

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh my God!

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh my God!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Sweet cake!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
No!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
No, no, please!

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
No!

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
No!

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
No!

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
No!

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
No!

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
No!

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
No!

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
No!

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
No!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
What?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Is that...

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
No!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
No, no, no!

06:41.000 --> 06:55.000
I can't swim, I can't swim!

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Yes, yes!

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
No! No!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Suckers, I sprained you!

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't want to hurt you, just keep your distance!

07:16.000 --> 07:28.000
Alright then, eat salt you little green bastards!

07:46.000 --> 08:07.000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free! Now you'll join them!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Suckers!

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'll give you that one, Brother Bird!

08:48.000 --> 09:14.000
Alright Sprites, let's burn the bunnies and have some peppermint tea!

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Danger, danger! I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way!

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm about to blast it, stick like plastic, what your mama gonna say?

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it, I'mma just catch you in steam!

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Now pillage, and nude it, I'mma pollute it, lake to the river, to the stream, push, pop!

09:32.000 --> 09:45.000
Pull you a little dearie, then call me Cavalieri, try to cut me down to size!

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Now there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, baking me cakes and pies!

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah this camp is a call out, here come the fall out, me and my crew don't play!

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
My poos on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut words and the truth to say! Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:59.000 --> 10:09.000
City kid, city kid, run! City kid, run! City kid, city kid, run! City kid run!
