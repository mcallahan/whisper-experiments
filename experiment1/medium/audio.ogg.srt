1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,240
Oh, you cute little corny little sparsome.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
Blatanty.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
Bonus points.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:30,840
Ugh, can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger.

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,760
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill her.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,280
Relax sugar puns, while she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,560
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds.

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,560
Way ahead of you, man.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Come on team, we mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,560
I was thinking, we should call our class project Fun Guys in a Forest.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Get it?

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Shush!

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,560
That's a low-wage tale, and she's in distress.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,560
There they are, my little Montesilaf larva.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Oh, look at her go.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
Wow.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Out of the way, dork-wad.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
We're camping here.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Finally.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Time to get that barbecue burning.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Oh, oh dear.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
Gross.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

25
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Piss break.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,560
Oi, fungus freak, make yourself useful and fix the tent.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Fun.

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,560
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Yeah, she's a real weenie that one, innit?

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Oi, Phil, our new sausage is coming.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Almost ready.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:28,560
We just need a bit more salt.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Incredible, it's a new species.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
What the bloody hell are those things?

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
It's like a note shagged a mushroom.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
They're absolutely adorable.

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
We'd be famous.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
Get on MTV.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I wonder what they taste like.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Right.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Should we?

46
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
We should.

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
We should.

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
We should.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
We should.

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
We should.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
We should.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
We should.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,560
We should.

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Right, sure, sure.

55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Greetings.

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Welcome, friends.

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I'll be right down.

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
What are you guys?

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
We're sprites.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
We sprite balance to the forest.

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,800
Take care of the animals.

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,600
Squants, birds, swans, ladybugs.

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:46,680
Squirrels, bees, squirrels, a small, small species of grass.

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,840
Hey, little mushroom geezer, you call with us

66
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,480
camping here for the night?

67
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,800
Absolutely.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,640
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint.

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,800
Yeah, maybe they were just painting

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,800
their little hats or something.

72
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,960
Guys?

73
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,320
Guys?

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Guys, this isn't funny.

75
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:33,400
Guys?

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
They've got to get me out of these hurry.

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
They've got to kill us.

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
Hurry.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,320
Wait for the F for leaf and stone.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,440
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,920
Spray them!

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Run!

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:14,840
You little freaks!

85
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,000
Spray this!

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah!

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh my God!

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh my God!

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh my God!

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sugarman! Sugarman, help me!

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh my God!

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh my God!

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sweet cake!

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No!

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, no, please!

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No!

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No!

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No!

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No!

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No!

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No!

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No!

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No!

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No!

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What?

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is that...

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No!

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, no, no!

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can't swim, I can't swim!

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, yes!

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No! No!

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Suckers, I sprained you!

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't want to hurt you, just keep your distance!

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alright then, eat salt you little green bastards!

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free! Now you'll join them!

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Suckers!

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll give you that one, Brother Bird!

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Alright Sprites, let's burn the bunnies and have some peppermint tea!

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Danger, danger! I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way!

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm about to blast it, stick like plastic, what your mama gonna say?

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it, I'mma just catch you in steam!

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now pillage, and nude it, I'mma pollute it, lake to the river, to the stream, push, pop!

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Pull you a little dearie, then call me Cavalieri, try to cut me down to size!

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, baking me cakes and pies!

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah this camp is a call out, here come the fall out, me and my crew don't play!

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My poos on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut words and the truth to say! Hey! Hey! Hey!

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
City kid, city kid, run! City kid, run! City kid, city kid, run! City kid run!
