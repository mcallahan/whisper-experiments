00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello Mr Snail, oh you cute little corny was sparesome, that name, bonus points.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger, if I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal I swear I'm gonna kill her.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Relax sugar buns, while she does all the work we'll have all the fun.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah and get wasted out of our minds, where are you man?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on team, we mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I was thinking we should call our class project Fun Guys in a Forest.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Shush, that's the yellow bird team and she's in distress.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There there are little monsters in a flower.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, look at her go.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wow.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Out of the way talk one, we're camping here.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Finally, time to get that barbecue burning.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh dear.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature not wrecking it.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Kiss break.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oi, fungus freak, make yourself usable and fix the tent.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Fun asked.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, she's a real weenie that one, isn't it?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oi, Phil, no sausages coming.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Almost ready.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We need a bit more salt.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Huh?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's incredible, it's a new species.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What the bloody hell are those things?

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's like a no shag to mushrooms.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They're absolutely adorable.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable and I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We'd be famous.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Get on MTV, I wonder what they taste like.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right, sure, sure.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Greetings.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Welcome friends, I'll be right down.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you guys?

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We are sprites, we sprite balance to the forest.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We take care of the animals.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Guys, guys.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey, little mushroom geezer, you call with us camping here for the night?

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Absolutely, a friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe, maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Guys?

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Guys?

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Guys, this isn't funny.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Guys?

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're just going to catch one with their psycho.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They've got to get me out of these hurry, they're going to kill us.

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ready, ready, go.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hurry.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We'll leap and stroll.

56
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sprite time.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sprite.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sprite time.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
She has a wife to help me!

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Help me!

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh!

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh!

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh!

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, no!

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, no!

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh!

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sweet cake!

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh!

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh!

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh!

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh!

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh!

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh!

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh!

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh!

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh!

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh!

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh!

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh!

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh!

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh!

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh!

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh!

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ah!

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What?

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is that?

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No!

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, no, no!

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh!

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't swim!

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't swim!

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No!

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No one has gone away.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What?

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No!

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No, no, no!

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So,

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, Yes!

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No! No!

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,560
S

102
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
S

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
S

104
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
S

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
S

106
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
S

107
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
S

108
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,560
S

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
S

110
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
S

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,560
All right then, eat salty little green bastards!

112
00:07:46,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free!

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Now you'll join them!

114
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:48,560
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,560
All right, sprites, let's burn the bunnies and have some peppermint tea!

116
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Give things up, where are we wrong? Die, be die, Billy, before it steals our happy home! We all together now!

117
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,560
It's friendly, sprite, sprite, is it the sun? It's friendly, be sprite, be the moon?

118
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
It's friendly, aye, aye, aye, yum, yum!

119
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way!

120
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,560
I'm about to blast this dick like plastic, what ya mama gonna say?

121
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I'm about to drop it, stanky, drop it, I'ma just catch in steam!

122
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Now pillage, and loot it, I'ma pollute it, lake to the river to the stream for spawn!

123
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Follow a little deary, then call me cavalry, try to cut me down to size!

124
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Now there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, bacon, meat, cakes, and pies! This camp is a call out, here come the fallout, me and my crew don't play!

125
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,560
My boots on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut walls in the tree to say, hey, hey, hey!

126
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:19,560
City kid, city kid rock, city kid rock!

127
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
You
