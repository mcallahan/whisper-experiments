Hello Mr Snail, oh you cute little corny was sparesome, that name, bonus points.

00:25.000 --> 00:34.000
Can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger, if I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Relax sugar buns, while she does all the work we'll have all the fun.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah and get wasted out of our minds, where are you man?

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Come on team, we mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
I was thinking we should call our class project Fun Guys in a Forest.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Shush, that's the yellow bird team and she's in distress.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
There there are little monsters in a flower.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Oh, look at her go.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Wow.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Out of the way talk one, we're camping here.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Finally, time to get that barbecue burning.

01:17.000 --> 01:31.000
Oh dear.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature not wrecking it.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Kiss break.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Oi, fungus freak, make yourself usable and fix the tent.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Fun asked.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, she's a real weenie that one, isn't it?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Oi, Phil, no sausages coming.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Almost ready.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
We need a bit more salt.

02:05.000 --> 02:33.000
Huh?

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
It's incredible, it's a new species.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
What the bloody hell are those things?

02:42.000 --> 02:57.000
It's like a no shag to mushrooms.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
They're absolutely adorable.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable and I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
We'd be famous.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Get on MTV, I wonder what they taste like.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Right, sure, sure.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Greetings.

03:17.000 --> 03:26.000
Welcome friends, I'll be right down.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
What are you guys?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
We are sprites, we sprite balance to the forest.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
We take care of the animals.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
What?

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
Guys, guys.

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Hey, little mushroom geezer, you call with us camping here for the night?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Absolutely, a friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe, maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
Guys?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Guys?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Guys, this isn't funny.

04:25.000 --> 04:47.000
Guys?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We're just going to catch one with their psycho.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
They've got to get me out of these hurry, they're going to kill us.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Ready, ready, go.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Hurry.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
We'll leap and stroll.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:03.000 --> 05:20.000
Sprite time.

05:20.000 --> 05:30.000
Sprite.

05:30.000 --> 05:58.000
Sprite time.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
She has a wife to help me!

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Help me!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh!

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Oh!

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh, no!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Oh, no!

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh!

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Sweet cake!

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Oh!

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Oh!

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Oh!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh!

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh!

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Oh!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Oh!

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Oh!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh!

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh!

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh!

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh!

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh!

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh!

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Ah!

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
What?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Is that?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
No!

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
No, no, no!

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
I can't swim!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
I can't swim!

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
No!

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
No one has gone away.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
What?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
No!

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No, no, no!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
So,

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes, Yes!

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
No! No!

07:00.000 --> 07:07.560
S

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
S

07:08.560 --> 07:09.560
S

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
S

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
S

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
S

07:12.560 --> 07:13.560
S

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
S

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
S

07:15.560 --> 07:16.560
S

07:16.560 --> 07:20.560
All right then, eat salty little green bastards!

07:46.560 --> 08:05.560
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free!

08:05.560 --> 08:17.560
Now you'll join them!

08:35.560 --> 08:48.560
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

08:48.560 --> 08:55.560
All right, sprites, let's burn the bunnies and have some peppermint tea!

08:55.560 --> 09:04.560
Give things up, where are we wrong? Die, be die, Billy, before it steals our happy home! We all together now!

09:04.560 --> 09:11.560
It's friendly, sprite, sprite, is it the sun? It's friendly, be sprite, be the moon?

09:11.560 --> 09:13.560
It's friendly, aye, aye, aye, yum, yum!

09:13.560 --> 09:17.560
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way!

09:17.560 --> 09:22.560
I'm about to blast this dick like plastic, what ya mama gonna say?

09:22.560 --> 09:26.560
I'm about to drop it, stanky, drop it, I'ma just catch in steam!

09:26.560 --> 09:40.560
Now pillage, and loot it, I'ma pollute it, lake to the river to the stream for spawn!

09:40.560 --> 09:45.560
Follow a little deary, then call me cavalry, try to cut me down to size!

09:45.560 --> 09:54.560
Now there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, bacon, meat, cakes, and pies! This camp is a call out, here come the fallout, me and my crew don't play!

09:54.560 --> 09:59.560
My boots on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut walls in the tree to say, hey, hey, hey!

09:59.560 --> 10:19.560
City kid, city kid rock, city kid rock!

10:29.560 --> 10:31.560
