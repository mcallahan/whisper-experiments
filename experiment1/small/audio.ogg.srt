00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello Mr. Snail! Oh, you cute little corny was sparsome. That name, bonus points!

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger. If I have to hear the latter name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Relax sugar buns. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Where are you man?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Come on team, we mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see. I was thinking we should call our class project fun guys in a forest.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys. Shush!

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's the yellow bird team, and she's in distress!

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There they are, my little Monticello flower.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, look at her go. Wow.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Out of the way, Dorkwood. We're camping here.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Finally. Time to get that barbecue burning.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, oh, oh dear.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Piss break!

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oi, fungus freak, make yourself useful and fix the tent.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, she's a real weenie that one, innit?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oi, Phil, no sausages coming.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Almost ready. Just need a bit more salt.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's incredible. It's a new species.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What the bloody hell are those things? It's like a note shagged a mushroom.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, they're absolutely adorable.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We'll be famous.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Get on MTV. I wonder what they taste like.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right. Sure.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sure.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Greetings. Welcome, friends. I'll be right down.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you guys?

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We are sprites. We sprites balanced to the forest.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We take care of the animals.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Squants.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Birds.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Guys. Guys.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer. You call with us camping here for the night?

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Maybe, maybe it was just ketchup or something like red.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

43
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Guys.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Guys.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Guys, this isn't funny.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Guys.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I am lost.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We've been watching the wind.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Friendly, free, friendly, go.

50
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We're going to the forest.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's go.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's go.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's go.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Guys, we're just going to catch one, right there's a psycho.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They'll be out of this hurry. They're going to kill us.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Free, friendly, go.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Really?

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right foot left for leave and store.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Spray time.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No!

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Time for a little flicks.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's try this!

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Fire!

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh my god!

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh my god!

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh my god!

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shagamon! Shagamon! Help me!

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh my god!

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh my god!

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wait, Shagamon!

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Shagamon!

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What? Is that...

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No! No!

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't swim! I can't swim!

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes! Yes!

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No! No!

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Shagamon! Shagamon!

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't want to hurt you! Just keep your distance!

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Alright then! Eat salty little green bastards!

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin! And you set them free! Now you'll join them!

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh my god!

91
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Alright sprites! Let's burn the bunnies and have some peppermint tea!

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Give me much where every room,

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Gah-ee-ee, Gah-ee, Billy, the forest is our happy home!

95
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ho-ho-ha-ha, we all together now!

96
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sprites, sprites, sprites, like the sun!

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Spraint-ee-ee, spraint-ee-um,

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We will stop till the day is fun!

99
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Spraint-ee-ee, ay-ay-ay-ay-yum-yum!

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Danger, danger! I'm a forest ranger!

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
About and clear the way!

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm about to blast it, stick like plastic!

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What's your mama gonna say?

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm about to drop it, stanky plop it!

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'ma just catch you in steam!

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Now pillage and loot it!

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'ma pollute it!

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Lake to the river to the stream!

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We'll spot!

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We're a little deary and call me Cavaliery!

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Try to cut me down to size!

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
One of these my announcer, driver, bouncer!

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Bacon made cakes and pies!

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, this camp is a cut-out!

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Here come the fallout!

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Me and my crew don't play!

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
My booze on the log and the leaf on the fire!

118
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Cut words in the tree to say!

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Hey, hey, hey!

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sing it, sing it, rock!

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sing it, rock!

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sing it, sing it, rock!

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sing it, rock!
