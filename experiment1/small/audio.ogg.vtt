00:00.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello Mr. Snail! Oh, you cute little corny was sparsome. That name, bonus points!

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh, can't believe we got stuck with a tree hugger. If I have to hear the latter name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Relax sugar buns. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Where are you man?

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
Come on team, we mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see. I was thinking we should call our class project fun guys in a forest.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys. Shush!

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
That's the yellow bird team, and she's in distress!

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
There they are, my little Monticello flower.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, look at her go. Wow.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Out of the way, Dorkwood. We're camping here.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Finally. Time to get that barbecue burning.

01:17.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, oh, oh dear.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Piss break!

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Oi, fungus freak, make yourself useful and fix the tent.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, she's a real weenie that one, innit?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Oi, Phil, no sausages coming.

01:59.000 --> 02:15.000
Almost ready. Just need a bit more salt.

02:29.000 --> 02:39.000
It's incredible. It's a new species.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
What the bloody hell are those things? It's like a note shagged a mushroom.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh, they're absolutely adorable.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
We'll be famous.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Get on MTV. I wonder what they taste like.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Right. Sure.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Sure.

03:10.000 --> 03:18.000
Greetings. Welcome, friends. I'll be right down.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
What are you guys?

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
We are sprites. We sprites balanced to the forest.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
We take care of the animals.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Squants.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Birds.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
Guys. Guys.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer. You call with us camping here for the night?

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Maybe, maybe it was just ketchup or something like red.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Guys.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Guys.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Guys, this isn't funny.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Guys.

04:17.000 --> 04:28.000
I am lost.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
We've been watching the wind.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Friendly, free, friendly, go.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
We're going to the forest.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Let's go.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Let's go.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Let's go.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Let's go.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's go.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Let's go.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Let's go.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Let's go.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Let's go.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Let's go.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Let's go.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Guys, we're just going to catch one, right there's a psycho.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
They'll be out of this hurry. They're going to kill us.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Free, friendly, go.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Really?

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Right foot left for leave and store.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Spray time.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
No!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Time for a little flicks.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Let's try this!

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Fire!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh my god!

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Oh my god!

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh my god!

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Shagamon! Shagamon! Help me!

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh my god!

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Oh my god!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Wait, Shagamon!

06:09.000 --> 06:32.000
Shagamon!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
What? Is that...

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
No! No!

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I can't swim! I can't swim!

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes! Yes!

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
No! No!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Shagamon! Shagamon!

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't want to hurt you! Just keep your distance!

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
Alright then! Eat salty little green bastards!

07:46.000 --> 08:07.000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin! And you set them free! Now you'll join them!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh my god!

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Alright sprites! Let's burn the bunnies and have some peppermint tea!

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Give me much where every room,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Gah-ee-ee, Gah-ee, Billy, the forest is our happy home!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Ho-ho-ha-ha, we all together now!

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Sprites, sprites, sprites, like the sun!

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Spraint-ee-ee, spraint-ee-um,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
We will stop till the day is fun!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Spraint-ee-ee, ay-ay-ay-ay-yum-yum!

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Danger, danger! I'm a forest ranger!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
About and clear the way!

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm about to blast it, stick like plastic!

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
What's your mama gonna say?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I'm about to drop it, stanky plop it!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'ma just catch you in steam!

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Now pillage and loot it!

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I'ma pollute it!

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Lake to the river to the stream!

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
We'll spot!

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
We're a little deary and call me Cavaliery!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
One of these my announcer, driver, bouncer!

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Bacon made cakes and pies!

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, this camp is a cut-out!

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Here come the fallout!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Me and my crew don't play!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
My booze on the log and the leaf on the fire!

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Cut words in the tree to say!

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Hey, hey, hey!

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
