00:17.382 --> 00:19.465
Hello, Mr.Snail!

00:19.465 --> 00:22.340
Aw, you cute little cornu aspersum.

00:22.340 --> 00:25.132
Latin name bonus-points!

00:28.382 --> 00:30.840
Can’t believe we got stuck with the tree hugger.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.674
If I have to hear the latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:34.674 --> 00:39.549
Relax, Sugar Buns. While she does all the work we’ll have all the fun.

00:39.549 --> 00:42.590
Yeah! And get wasted out of our minds!

00:42.590 --> 00:44.257
Way ahead of you, man.

00:44.257 --> 00:48.632
C’mon, team! We mustn’t dilly-dally when there’s so much nature to see!

00:48.632 --> 00:53.674
I was thinking we should call our class project, “Fungis in a Forest!”

00:53.674 --> 00:56.174
Get it? Because we’re a group of fun guys.

00:56.174 --> 00:57.674
And also fungis which-

00:57.674 --> 01:02.465
Shush! That’s a yellow wagtail. And she’s in distress!

01:02.757 --> 01:06.340
There, there, my little motacilla flava.

01:07.799 --> 01:10.049
Oh! Look at her go!

01:10.382 --> 01:11.507
Wow!

01:11.507 --> 01:14.424
Out of the way, dorkwad! We're camping here.

01:14.424 --> 01:17.507
Finally! Time to get that BBQ burning.

01:18.424 --> 01:20.174
Oh. Oh, dear.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.882
Gross!

01:30.840 --> 01:35.465
Oh. Easy, guys. We’re supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

01:35.465 --> 01:37.965
Piss break!

01:40.715 --> 01:44.674
Oy, fungus freak! Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

01:44.674 --> 01:48.924
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

01:49.882 --> 01:52.590
She wouldn't survive 5 minutes alone in these woods.

01:52.590 --> 01:56.799
Yeah. She's a real weenie that one, innit?

01:56.799 --> 01:59.007
Oy, Phil! How those sausages coming?

01:59.007 --> 02:02.465
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt...

02:36.340 --> 02:39.215
It's incredible. It's a new species.

02:39.215 --> 02:41.882
What the bloody hell are those things?

02:41.882 --> 02:44.549
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom.

02:57.382 --> 02:59.590
They’re absolutely adorable.

02:59.590 --> 03:02.007
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

03:02.007 --> 03:05.632
And I bet we’ll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:05.632 --> 03:06.965
We'd be famous!

03:06.965 --> 03:08.299
Get on MTV.

03:08.299 --> 03:09.882
I wonder what they taste like.

03:09.882 --> 03:12.507
We really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

03:12.507 --> 03:15.924
Right. Sure, sure.

03:15.924 --> 03:17.507
Greetings.

03:17.507 --> 03:19.007
Welcome, friends.

03:19.007 --> 03:21.215
I'll be right down.

03:26.257 --> 03:28.757
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:28.757 --> 03:30.674
What are you guys?

03:30.674 --> 03:34.424
We are Sprites. We sprite balance to the forest.

03:34.424 --> 03:39.674
We take care of the animals, plants, birds, moss...

03:41.007 --> 03:43.924
Guys? Guys, I...

03:46.590 --> 03:51.549
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer, you cool with us camping here for the night?

03:51.549 --> 03:56.340
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

03:57.715 --> 04:01.382
Maybe it was just ketchup... or something... like...

04:01.382 --> 04:09.132
Red paint? Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or... something...

04:15.507 --> 04:17.049
Guys?

04:20.090 --> 04:21.632
Guys?

04:22.424 --> 04:23.965
Guys, this isn't funny.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.632
Guys?

04:47.215 --> 04:50.174
We were just gonna catch one! But they’re psycho!

04:50.174 --> 04:52.965
You gotta get me outta these! Hurry! They’re gonna kill us!

04:55.674 --> 04:56.590
Hurry!

04:56.590 --> 04:59.465
Right foot, left foot, leaf and stone.

04:59.465 --> 05:03.590
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:03.590 --> 05:05.299
Sprite them!

05:05.840 --> 05:07.549
Run!!!

05:30.257 --> 05:32.090
Aaaah! My eyes!

05:57.632 --> 05:59.632
Sugar Buns?! Help me!

06:07.132 --> 06:08.882
Sweet cakes!

06:11.299 --> 06:13.215
Love muffin...

06:14.174 --> 06:15.674
Huh?

06:40.049 --> 06:43.465
No, no, no! I can’t swim!

06:55.090 --> 06:56.882
Yes!

06:58.299 --> 06:59.715
No!

07:12.840 --> 07:16.215
I don’t want to hurt you! Just keep your distance!

07:17.215 --> 07:21.132
All right, then. Eat salt, you little green bastards!

07:56.840 --> 07:58.549
Nuh-uh-uh.

07:58.549 --> 08:03.340
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.632
And you set them free!

08:05.632 --> 08:07.840
Now you'll join them!

08:45.882 --> 08:49.174
I’ll give you that one, Brother Bird!

08:50.007 --> 08:55.424
Alright sprites, let’s burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.
