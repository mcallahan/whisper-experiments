00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
Hello, Mr. Snail! Oh, you cute little corny wasp-ersome!

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Lightning! Bonus points!

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
Can't believe we got stuck with the tree-hugger. If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill her!

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Relax, Sugar Buns! While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun!

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds! Way ahead of you, man!

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Come on, team! We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see!

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
I was thinking, we should call our class project, Funguys in a Forest!

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun-guys and also fun-guys!

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Shush! That's a low-word, team! And she's in distress!

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
There, there, my little Monticello flower!

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, look at her go! Wow!

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Out of the way, talkwad! We're camping here!

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Finally! Time to get that barbecue burning!

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh, oh dear!

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Gross!

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Easy, guys! We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it!

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Piss break!

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Oi! Fungus-free! Make yourself useful and fix the tent!

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing! Fun!

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods!

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Oi, Phil! Arno sausages coming!

01:59.000 --> 02:15.000
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It's incredible! It's a new species!

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
What the bloody hell are those things?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom!

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
They're absolutely adorable!

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable!

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
We'd be famous!

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Get on MTV! I wonder what they taste like!

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat!

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Right! Sure, sure!

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Greetings! Welcome, friends! I'll be right down!

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
What are you guys?

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
We are sprites! We sprite balance to the forest!

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
We take care of the animals, plants, birds...

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Guys! Guys!

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Hey, little mushroom-geezer!

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
You call with us camping here for the night?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Absolutely! A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites!

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

04:03.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Guys?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Guys?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Guys, this isn't funny!

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
Guys?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho!

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
We've got to get me out of these! Hurry! They're gonna kill us!

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Hurry!

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Right for left for leaf and stone!

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches!

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Sprite them!

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Take that, you little freaks!

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Sprite this!

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Help!

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Help! Fire!

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh my God!

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Sugar boy! Sugar boy, help me!

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Help me!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Sugar!

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Sugar!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Weakling!

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
No!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
No, stop it!

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
What?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Is that?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
No!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I can't swim!

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I can't swim!

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Yes! Yes!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
No!

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
No!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I don't want to hurt you!

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Just keep your distance!

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Alright then!

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
You little green bastard!

07:49.000 --> 08:03.000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin!

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
And you set them free!

08:05.000 --> 08:20.000
Now you'll join them!

08:35.000 --> 08:49.000
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
Alright Sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

08:55.000 --> 09:05.000
And keep in touch wherever we roam! Daddy bee, daddy billy, the forest is our happy home!

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Sprite this, Sprite Sprite, lick the sun! Sprite the bees, Sprite the gum!

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
And we won't stop till the day is done! Sprite the eye-eye-eye-yum-yum!

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Danger! Danger! I'm a forest ranger! About and clear the way!

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
I'm about to blast this stick like plastic! What's your mama gonna say?

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it! I'mma just catch you in steam!

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
Now pillaged and looted, I'mma pollute it! Lake to the river, to the stream, full spunk!

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
We were little deary, then called me cavaliery, tried to cut me down to size!

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
Now there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, bakin' me cakes and pies!

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Yeah, this camp is a call-out, here come the fallout, me and my crew don't play!

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
My proof's on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut words and the truth to say!

10:00.000 --> 10:21.000
Syndicate, syndicate, roll! Syndicate, roll!
