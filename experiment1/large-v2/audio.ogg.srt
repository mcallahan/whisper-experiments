00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello, Mr. Snail! Oh, you cute little corny wasp-ersome!

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Lightning! Bonus points!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can't believe we got stuck with the tree-hugger. If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill her!

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Relax, Sugar Buns! While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun!

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds! Way ahead of you, man!

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on, team! We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was thinking, we should call our class project, Funguys in a Forest!

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun-guys and also fun-guys!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Shush! That's a low-word, team! And she's in distress!

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There, there, my little Monticello flower!

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, look at her go! Wow!

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Out of the way, talkwad! We're camping here!

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Finally! Time to get that barbecue burning!

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, oh dear!

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gross!

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Easy, guys! We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it!

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Piss break!

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oi! Fungus-free! Make yourself useful and fix the tent!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing! Fun!

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods!

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oi, Phil! Arno sausages coming!

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's incredible! It's a new species!

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What the bloody hell are those things?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom!

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They're absolutely adorable!

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable!

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things!

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We'd be famous!

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Get on MTV! I wonder what they taste like!

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat!

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right! Sure, sure!

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Greetings! Welcome, friends! I'll be right down!

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you guys?

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We are sprites! We sprite balance to the forest!

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We take care of the animals, plants, birds...

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Guys! Guys!

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, little mushroom-geezer!

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You call with us camping here for the night?

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Absolutely! A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites!

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Guys?

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Guys?

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Guys, this isn't funny!

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Guys?

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho!

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We've got to get me out of these! Hurry! They're gonna kill us!

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hurry!

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right for left for leaf and stone!

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches!

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Sprite them!

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Take that, you little freaks!

56
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sprite this!

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Help!

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Help! Fire!

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh my God!

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't look! Don't look! Don't look!

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sugar boy! Sugar boy, help me!

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Help me!

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sugar!

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sugar!

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Weakling!

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No!

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, stop it!

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is that?

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No!

71
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't swim!

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't swim!

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes! Yes!

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No!

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No!

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't want to hurt you!

77
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Just keep your distance!

78
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Alright then!

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You little green bastard!

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin!

81
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And you set them free!

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now you'll join them!

83
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll give you that one, brother bird!

84
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Alright Sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea!

85
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And keep in touch wherever we roam! Daddy bee, daddy billy, the forest is our happy home!

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sprite this, Sprite Sprite, lick the sun! Sprite the bees, Sprite the gum!

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And we won't stop till the day is done! Sprite the eye-eye-eye-yum-yum!

88
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Danger! Danger! I'm a forest ranger! About and clear the way!

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm about to blast this stick like plastic! What's your mama gonna say?

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it! I'mma just catch you in steam!

91
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Now pillaged and looted, I'mma pollute it! Lake to the river, to the stream, full spunk!

92
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We were little deary, then called me cavaliery, tried to cut me down to size!

93
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now there's my announcer, driver, bouncer, bakin' me cakes and pies!

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, this camp is a call-out, here come the fallout, me and my crew don't play!

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
My proof's on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut words and the truth to say!

96
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Syndicate, syndicate, roll! Syndicate, roll!
