1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,960
I can't believe we got stuck with the tree.

2
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,960
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Relax, sugar buns. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Way ahead of you, man.

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Come on, team. We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

6
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,960
I was thinking, we should call our class project Fungi's in a forest.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Shush! There'll be no work, team. And she's in distress.

9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,960
There then, little Monticello Flava.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Oh, look at her go. Wow.

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Out of the way, dorkwad. We're camping here.

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Finally. Time to get that barbecue burning.

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,960
Oh, oh dear.

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:34,960
Easy, guys. We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Piss break.

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
Oi, fungus free. Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,960
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Oi, Phil. Are those sausages coming?

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
Almost ready.

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,960
We just need a bit more salt.

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Huh?

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Incredible. It's a new species.

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:55,960
What the bloody hell are those things? It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom.

26
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,960
They're absolutely adorable.

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable. And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
We'd be famous.

29
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,960
Get on MTV. I wonder what they taste like.

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Right. Sure, sure.

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Greetings.

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Welcome, friends. I'll be right down.

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
What are you guys?

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:40,960
We are sprites. We sprite balance to the forest. We take care of the animals.

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Guys, guys.

38
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Hey, little mushroom geezer. You call with us camping here for the night?

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Maybe it was just ketchup or something, like red paint.

41
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

42
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Guys, guys, guys, this isn't funny.

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Guys?

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,960
We were just going to catch one with their psycho. They're going to get me out of this hurry. They're going to kill us.

45
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Hurry.

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Left for leaf and story.

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,960
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Spray them.

49
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Spray this.

50
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:58,960
No, no, no.

51
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Sweet cake.

52
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:33,960
No, no, no.

53
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Is that?

54
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Yes, yes.

55
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:16,960
I don't want to hurt you. Just just keep your distance.

56
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:45,960
All right, then, eat salty little green bastards.

57
00:07:45,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free. Now you join them.

58
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,960
No, no, no, no.

59
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

60
00:08:49,960 --> 00:09:13,960
All right, sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

61
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way. I'm about to blast it, stick like plastic, what's your mama gonna say?

62
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it, I'm just catching steam. Now pillage and loot it, I'm a polluted lake to the river, to the stream.

63
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I'll borrow a little dearie and call me cavalierie, try to cut me down to size.

64
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Loyalty's my announcer, driver, bouncer, bakin' me cakes and pies.

65
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Yeah, this camp is a call out, here come the fallout, me and my crew don't play.

66
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,960
My boos on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut walls and the trees to say, hey, hey, hey.

67
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Sick and sick and rough, sick and rough.
