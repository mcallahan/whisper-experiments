00:00.000 --> 00:29.960
I can't believe we got stuck with the tree.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.960
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.960
Relax, sugar buns. While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:38.960 --> 00:43.960
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds. Way ahead of you, man.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.960
Come on, team. We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.960
I was thinking, we should call our class project Fungi's in a forest.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.960
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.960
Shush! There'll be no work, team. And she's in distress.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.960
There then, little Monticello Flava.

01:05.960 --> 01:10.960
Oh, look at her go. Wow.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.960
Out of the way, dorkwad. We're camping here.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.960
Finally. Time to get that barbecue burning.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.960
Oh, oh dear.

01:21.960 --> 01:34.960
Easy, guys. We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.960
Piss break.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.960
Oi, fungus free. Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.960
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing. Fun.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.960
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.960
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

01:56.960 --> 01:58.960
Oi, Phil. Are those sausages coming?

01:58.960 --> 02:00.960
Almost ready.

02:00.960 --> 02:07.960
We just need a bit more salt.

02:07.960 --> 02:26.960
Huh?

02:26.960 --> 02:38.960
Incredible. It's a new species.

02:38.960 --> 02:55.960
What the bloody hell are those things? It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.960
They're absolutely adorable.

02:58.960 --> 03:04.960
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable. And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.960
We'd be famous.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.960
Get on MTV. I wonder what they taste like.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.960
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.960
Right. Sure, sure.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.960
Greetings.

03:16.960 --> 03:25.960
Welcome, friends. I'll be right down.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.960
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:28.960 --> 03:30.960
What are you guys?

03:30.960 --> 03:40.960
We are sprites. We sprite balance to the forest. We take care of the animals.

03:40.960 --> 03:46.960
Guys, guys.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.960
Hey, little mushroom geezer. You call with us camping here for the night?

03:50.960 --> 03:57.960
Absolutely. A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

03:57.960 --> 04:03.960
Maybe it was just ketchup or something, like red paint.

04:03.960 --> 04:14.960
Maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:14.960 --> 04:24.960
Guys, guys, guys, this isn't funny.

04:24.960 --> 04:46.960
Guys?

04:46.960 --> 04:55.960
We were just going to catch one with their psycho. They're going to get me out of this hurry. They're going to kill us.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
Hurry.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.960
Left for leaf and story.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.960
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches.

05:02.960 --> 05:20.960
Spray them.

05:20.960 --> 05:35.960
Spray this.

05:35.960 --> 05:58.960
No, no, no.

05:58.960 --> 06:10.960
Sweet cake.

06:10.960 --> 06:33.960
No, no, no.

06:33.960 --> 06:45.960
Is that?

06:45.960 --> 06:57.960
Yes, yes.

06:57.960 --> 07:16.960
I don't want to hurt you. Just just keep your distance.

07:16.960 --> 07:45.960
All right, then, eat salty little green bastards.

07:45.960 --> 08:13.960
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free. Now you join them.

08:13.960 --> 08:20.960
No, no, no, no.

08:20.960 --> 08:49.960
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

08:49.960 --> 09:13.960
All right, sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

09:13.960 --> 09:22.960
Danger, danger, I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way. I'm about to blast it, stick like plastic, what's your mama gonna say?

09:22.960 --> 09:40.960
I'm about to drop it, stanky, plop it, I'm just catching steam. Now pillage and loot it, I'm a polluted lake to the river, to the stream.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.960
I'll borrow a little dearie and call me cavalierie, try to cut me down to size.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.960
Loyalty's my announcer, driver, bouncer, bakin' me cakes and pies.

09:49.960 --> 09:54.960
Yeah, this camp is a call out, here come the fallout, me and my crew don't play.

09:54.960 --> 09:59.960
My boos on the log, on the leaf, on the frog, cut walls and the trees to say, hey, hey, hey.

09:59.960 --> 10:19.960
Sick and sick and rough, sick and rough.
