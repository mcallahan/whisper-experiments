CONGRAMERAL STARES

00:14.640 --> 00:18.280
Easy and thin

00:17.960 --> 00:19.820
Hello Mr..Snail

00:21.100 --> 00:23.040

Oh, I can't believe we got to stop with a tree, Hugga.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.080
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal,

00:33.080 --> 00:34.480
I swear I'm going to kill her.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.160
Relax to the bun.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.160
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:39.160 --> 00:42.200
Yeah, I get wasted out of our minds.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.920
Where are you, man?

00:43.920 --> 00:44.920
Come on, team.

00:44.920 --> 00:48.400
We mustn't dilly, Dally, when there's so much nature to see.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.000
I'm thinking we should call our class project,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.400
fun guys that are boys.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.400
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
Shush!

00:58.400 --> 01:02.400
That's the Latin, and she's in distress.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.400
There's a little more to set up lava.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.400
So, let me show you.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Wow.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
Out of the way, talk what?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
We're camping here.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
Finally.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.400
Turn to get that barbecue burning.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.400
Oh.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.400
Oh, dear.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.400
Ah.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.400
Oh, God.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.400
Easy guys, what's the purpose of studying nature?

01:33.400 --> 01:35.400
Not breaking it.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.400
Pist-break.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.400
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
Oh.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
Oi, fungers freak.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.400
Make yourself useful, and fix the tent.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Oh.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
They've been a friendly camp site ribbing.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
Oh, my God.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.400
She went to my five minutes alone in these woods.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
Oh, yeah.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.400
She's a real weeny that won't in it.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.400
Oi, Phil.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
Oh, no sausages coming.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.400
Almost ready.

01:59.400 --> 02:24.400
We're going to eat a bit more so.

02:24.400 --> 02:39.400
It's like a no-shagged mushroom.

02:39.400 --> 02:56.400
It's like a no-shagged mushroom.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.400
Yeah, absolutely adorable.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.400
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.400
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.400
We be famous.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.400
Get on MTV.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.400
I wonder what they taste like.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.400
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt that habitat.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.400
Right.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.400
Sure.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400
Sure.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
Great thing.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
We are sprites.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.400
We sprate balance to the forest.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.400
We take care of the animals.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
We're sprites.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400

03:38.400 --> 03:40.400

You call with us camping in for the night?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Absolutely.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.400
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

03:56.400 --> 04:02.400
Maybe it was just catch up or something like red paint?

04:02.400 --> 04:04.400
Yeah, maybe they were just...

04:04.400 --> 04:08.400
painting their little hats or something.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.400

04:49.400 --> 04:51.400

04:56.400 --> 04:57.400
