Oh, I can't believe we got to stop with a tree, Hugga.
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal,
I swear I'm going to kill her.
Relax to the bun.
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.
Yeah, I get wasted out of our minds.
Where are you, man?
Come on, team.
We mustn't dilly, Dally, when there's so much nature to see.
I'm thinking we should call our class project,
fun guys that are boys.
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.
Shush!
That's the Latin, and she's in distress.
There's a little more to set up lava.
So, let me show you.
