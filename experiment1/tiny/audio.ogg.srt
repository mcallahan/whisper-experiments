00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
CONGRAMERAL STARES

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,280
Easy and thin

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,820
Hello Mr..Snail

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,040
You cute little corny-w象

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,500
And Candy

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,160
B let me

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,720
Oh, I can't believe we got to stop with a tree, Hugga.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,080
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal,

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,480
I swear I'm going to kill her.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Relax to the bun.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,160
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,200
Yeah, I get wasted out of our minds.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,920
Where are you, man?

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
Come on, team.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,400
We mustn't dilly, Dally, when there's so much nature to see.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm thinking we should call our class project,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
fun guys that are boys.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Get it? Because we're a group of fun guys, and also fun guys.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Shush!

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
That's the Latin, and she's in distress.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,400
There's a little more to set up lava.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
So, let me show you.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Wow.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Out of the way, talk what?

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
We're camping here.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Finally.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Turn to get that barbecue burning.

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Oh.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Oh, dear.

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Ah.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Oh, God.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Easy guys, what's the purpose of studying nature?

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Not breaking it.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Pist-break.

35
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Oh.

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Oi, fungers freak.

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Make yourself useful, and fix the tent.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Oh.

40
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
They've been a friendly camp site ribbing.

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, my God.

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
She went to my five minutes alone in these woods.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Oh, yeah.

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
She's a real weeny that won't in it.

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Oi, Phil.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Oh, no sausages coming.

47
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Almost ready.

48
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:24,400
We're going to eat a bit more so.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:39,400
It's like a no-shagged mushroom.

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:56,400
It's like a no-shagged mushroom.

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah, absolutely adorable.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable.

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,400
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
We be famous.

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Get on MTV.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I wonder what they taste like.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt that habitat.

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Right.

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Sure.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Sure.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Great thing.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
What?

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Welcome friends.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'll be right down.

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Good eye interest you in some peppermint tea.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
What?

67
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
What are you guys?

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
We are sprites.

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
We sprate balance to the forest.

70
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
We take care of the animals.

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
We're sprites.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
What?

73
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
We're sprites.

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, guys, guys.

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Hey, a little mushroom gaser.

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,400
You call with us camping in for the night?

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Absolutely.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites.

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Maybe it was just catch up or something like red paint?

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Yeah, maybe they were just...

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
painting their little hats or something.

82
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Guys?

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Guys?

84
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Guys, this isn't funny.

85
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Nice.

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
We're just going to catch one.

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
But they're psycho.

88
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
We've got to get me out of these hurry.

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
We can't get up anymore.

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
We have to walk about now.

91
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
We've got to go now.

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
For the folk with historic wind...

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You pick the wrong camping spot, bitches.

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
S sólo!

95
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400

98
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,580
Spone!

99
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
No!

100
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580

121
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,580
No!

122
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,580
No!

123
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,320

125
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
No!

126
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
No!

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
No!

128
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320

141
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
We can't!

142
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320

143
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320

Oh!

150
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Oh, it's you.

151
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
It's me.

152
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,320
It's me.

153
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
I can't breathe.

154
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
I can't breathe.

155
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
What?

156
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
Is that it?

157
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
No.

158
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
No, no, no.

159
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
I can't breathe.

160
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I can't breathe.

161
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Oh, yes, yes.

162
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,320

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
No.

167
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
No.

168
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm going to scratch.

169
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I don't want to hurt you.

170
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Just keep not distance.

171
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
All right, then.

172
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
It's all too little green fosters.

173
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Ha!

174
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320

Ha!

195
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Those punks treat at the one that's her own personal rubbish bin.

196
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,320
And you don't shut them free.

197
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Now you're joining them.

198
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Ha!

I'll give you that one, brother bird.

211
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,320
All right, Sprite, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

212
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

213
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

214
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,320
The drop is stinky, drop it, I'm a just catch and sting.

215
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Now pillage and lint it, I'm a ballad, it lake to the river to best dream.

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

221
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:09,320
If you are sitting here, I'll take it around the world.
