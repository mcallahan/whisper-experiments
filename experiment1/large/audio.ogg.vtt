00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
Hello, Mr. Snail! Oh, you cute little corny wasp-ersome!

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Lightning! Bonus points!

00:26.000 --> 00:34.000
Can't believe we got stuck with the tree-hugger. If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill her!

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
Relax, Sugar Buns! While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun!

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds! Way ahead of you, man!

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Come on, team! We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see!

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
I was thinking, we should call our class project, Funguys in a Forest!

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun-guys and also fun-guys!

00:57.000 --> 01:02.000
Shush! That's a low-word, team! And she's in distress!

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
There, there, my little Monticello flower!

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh, look at her go! Wow!

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Out of the way, talkwad! We're camping here!

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Finally! Time to get that barbecue burning!

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh, oh dear!

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Gross!

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Easy, guys! We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it!

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Piss break!

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Oi! Fungus-free! Make yourself useful and fix the tent!

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing! Fun!

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods!

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Oi, Phil! Arno sausages coming!

01:59.000 --> 02:15.000
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
It's incredible! It's a new species!

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
What the bloody hell are those things?

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom!

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
They're absolutely adorable!

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable!

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
We'd be famous!

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Get on MTV! I wonder what they taste like!

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat!

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Right! Sure, sure!

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Greetings! Welcome, friends! I'll be right down!

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
What are you guys?

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
We are sprites! We sprite balance to the forest!

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
We take care of the animals, plants, birds...

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Guys! Guys!

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Hey, little mushroom-geezer!

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
You call with us camping here for the night?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
Absolutely! A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites!

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

04:03.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Guys?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Guys?

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Guys, this isn't funny!

04:25.000 --> 04:33.000
Guys?

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho!

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
You've got to get me out of this! Hurry! They're gonna kill us!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Hurry!

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Right foot, left foot, leaf and stone!

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches!

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Sprite them!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Oh

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I

07:10.000 --> 07:17.800
Don't want to hurt you just just keep your distance. All right, then

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Oh

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Oh

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh

07:46.000 --> 08:05.800
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin and you set them free now

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh

08:46.000 --> 08:53.540
Give you that one brother bird. All right sprites. Let's burn the bodies and have some

08:53.540 --> 08:55.540
Peppermint tea

09:14.140 --> 09:17.700
Danger danger, I'm a forest ranger about and clear the way

09:17.700 --> 09:22.140
I'm about to blast it stick like plastic. What's your mama gonna say?

09:23.580 --> 09:28.460
Drop it stanky flop it. I'm just catching steam now pillage and

09:29.860 --> 09:31.860
Lake to the river to the stream

09:31.860 --> 09:45.180
A little dearie and call me Cavalier. Try to cut me down to size

09:45.820 --> 09:49.740
There's my announcer driver bouncer baking me cakes and pies

09:49.740 --> 09:59.740
I

10:19.740 --> 10:21.740
You
