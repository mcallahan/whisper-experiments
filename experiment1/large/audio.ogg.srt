00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello, Mr. Snail! Oh, you cute little corny wasp-ersome!

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Lightning! Bonus points!

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can't believe we got stuck with the tree-hugger. If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal, I swear I'm going to kill her!

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Relax, Sugar Buns! While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun!

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, and get wasted out of our minds! Way ahead of you, man!

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Come on, team! We mustn't dilly-dally when there's so much nature to see!

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was thinking, we should call our class project, Funguys in a Forest!

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Get it? Because we're a group of fun-guys and also fun-guys!

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Shush! That's a low-word, team! And she's in distress!

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There, there, my little Monticello flower!

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, look at her go! Wow!

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Out of the way, talkwad! We're camping here!

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Finally! Time to get that barbecue burning!

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, oh dear!

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gross!

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Easy, guys! We're supposed to be studying nature, not wrecking it!

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Piss break!

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oi! Fungus-free! Make yourself useful and fix the tent!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, a bit of friendly campsite ribbing! Fun!

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She wouldn't survive five minutes alone in these woods!

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah, she's a real weenie, that one, innit?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oi, Phil! Arno sausages coming!

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Almost ready! Just need a bit more salt.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's incredible! It's a new species!

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What the bloody hell are those things?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like a gnome shagged a mushroom!

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They're absolutely adorable!

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable!

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things!

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We'd be famous!

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Get on MTV! I wonder what they taste like!

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat!

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right! Sure, sure!

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Greetings! Welcome, friends! I'll be right down!

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you guys?

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We are sprites! We sprite balance to the forest!

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We take care of the animals, plants, birds...

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Guys! Guys!

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, little mushroom-geezer!

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You call with us camping here for the night?

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Absolutely! A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites!

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Maybe it was just ketchup or something like red paint?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats or something.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Guys?

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Guys?

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Guys, this isn't funny!

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Guys?

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We were just going to catch one, but they're psycho!

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You've got to get me out of this! Hurry! They're gonna kill us!

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hurry!

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right foot, left foot, leaf and stone!

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches!

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sprite them!

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Oh

58
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh

59
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Don't want to hurt you just just keep your distance. All right, then

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh

62
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh

63
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh

64
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Those punks treated the world as their own personal rubbish bin and you set them free now

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh

66
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,540
Give you that one brother bird. All right sprites. Let's burn the bodies and have some

67
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,540
Peppermint tea

68
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,700
Danger danger, I'm a forest ranger about and clear the way

69
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm about to blast it stick like plastic. What's your mama gonna say?

70
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,460
Drop it stanky flop it. I'm just catching steam now pillage and

71
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Lake to the river to the stream

72
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:45,180
A little dearie and call me Cavalier. Try to cut me down to size

73
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,740
There's my announcer driver bouncer baking me cakes and pies

74
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I

75
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
You
