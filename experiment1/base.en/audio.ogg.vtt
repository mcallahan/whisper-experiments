00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Hello, Mr. Snail!

00:04.080 --> 00:21.080
Oh, you cute little corny wasperson, that name!

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Bonespoint!

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Ugh!

00:23.080 --> 00:29.280
Can't believe we got stuck with the tree!

00:29.280 --> 00:30.880
I'll start with a tree hugger.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.200
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal,

00:33.200 --> 00:34.640
I swear I'm gonna kill her.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.360
Relax, sugar buns.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.520
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.440
Yeah, I get wasted out of our minds.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.160
Where are you, man?

00:44.160 --> 00:46.160
Come on, team, we mustn't dilly dally

00:46.160 --> 00:48.640
when there's so much nature to see.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.160
I was thinking we should call our class project

00:51.160 --> 00:52.720
fun guys in a forest.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.400
Get it?

00:54.400 --> 00:57.600
Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

00:57.600 --> 01:02.840
Josh, nothing no right to you, and she's in distress.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.080
There are little monsters in a flower.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.440
Oh, look at her go.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.480
Wow.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.920
Out of the way, talk, what?

01:12.920 --> 01:14.440
We're camping here.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.480
Finally.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.200
Time to get that barbecue burning.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Oh.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.200
Oh, oh, oh.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
Oh.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.200
Oh.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.200
Oh.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.200
Oh.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.200
Oh.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
Oh.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
Oh.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.200
Oh.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.200
The ash.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.040
Oh.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.040
Oh.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.120
Oh, oh, ah.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.120
Hello.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.240
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature not

01:34.240 --> 01:35.760
wrecking it.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.040
Keys brake.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.680
shaped.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.080
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.080
Oh.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.080
Oi.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.080
Fungus free.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.960
Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

01:45.960 --> 01:46.960
Oh.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.160
I put a friendly campsite ribbing.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.320
Fun.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
US.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.980
She went to five, five minutes alone in these woods.

01:52.980 --> 01:53.980
Oh, yeah.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.800
She's a real weeny that one in it.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.020
Oi, Phil, I don't know sausage is coming.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.020
Almost ready.

02:00.860 --> 02:02.860
We're going to need a bit more salt.

02:04.860 --> 02:05.700
Ugh.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.540
Ugh.

02:06.540 --> 02:07.860
Ugh.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.860
Huh?

02:08.860 --> 02:09.860
Ugh.

02:09.860 --> 02:10.860
Ugh.

02:10.860 --> 02:11.860
Ugh.

02:11.860 --> 02:12.860
Ugh.

02:12.860 --> 02:13.860
Ugh.

02:13.860 --> 02:14.860
Ugh.

02:14.860 --> 02:15.860
Ugh.

02:15.860 --> 02:23.860
It's so.

02:30.800 --> 02:41.840
It's incredible, it's a new species.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.840
What?

02:43.840 --> 02:45.840
A bloody hell of those things.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.840
Be Frankie young, and we will stop to the day of fun

02:49.840 --> 02:51.840
Frankie, I am young, I am young

02:51.840 --> 02:53.840
We do watch the day we run

02:53.840 --> 02:55.840
Frankie, we do

02:55.840 --> 02:58.840
Yeah! They're absolutely adorable!

02:58.840 --> 03:01.840
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable!

03:01.840 --> 03:05.840
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.840
We'd be famous!

03:06.840 --> 03:09.840
Get on MTV! I wonder what they taste like?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.840
No, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.840
Why? Sure, sure.

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
Greetings!

03:16.840 --> 03:20.840
Welcome, friends! I'll be right down!

03:25.840 --> 03:28.840
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.840
What are you guys?

03:30.840 --> 03:33.840
We are sprites! We sprite balanced to the forest!

03:33.840 --> 03:35.840
We take care of the animals!

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
Scratch!

03:36.840 --> 03:37.840
What?

03:37.840 --> 03:39.840
Oh, geez!

03:39.840 --> 03:42.840
Oh, guys! Guys!

03:42.840 --> 03:44.840
Huh?

03:44.840 --> 03:46.840
Oh, this is a grass!

03:46.840 --> 03:48.840
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer!

03:48.840 --> 03:50.840
You call with us camping here for the night?

03:50.840 --> 03:52.840
Absolutely!

03:52.840 --> 03:56.840
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites!

03:56.840 --> 04:02.840
Maybe, maybe it was just sketch up or something like red paint?

04:02.840 --> 04:06.840
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats

04:06.840 --> 04:08.840
or something.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.840
Guys?

04:19.840 --> 04:21.840
Guys!

04:21.840 --> 04:24.840
Guys, this isn't funny!

04:24.840 --> 04:26.840
Guys?

04:29.840 --> 04:30.840
Yum yum yum!

04:30.840 --> 04:33.840
You can catch me when we die!

04:33.840 --> 04:36.840
Three, three, go!

04:47.840 --> 04:48.840
Wait, we're just gonna catch one!

04:48.840 --> 04:49.840
With their psycho!

04:49.840 --> 04:51.840
You've gotta get me out of these hurrys!

04:51.840 --> 04:52.840
Say, can we kill us?

04:52.840 --> 04:54.840
Three, three, go!

04:56.840 --> 04:57.840
Wait!

04:57.840 --> 04:59.840
We've been stalling!

04:59.840 --> 05:02.840
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches!

05:02.840 --> 05:04.840
Spray time!

05:04.840 --> 05:05.840
Oh!

05:17.840 --> 05:19.840
It's like the rocks!

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
The rocks!

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
The rocks!

05:21.840 --> 05:22.840
The rocks!

05:22.840 --> 05:25.840
AHHHH!

05:25.840 --> 05:27.840

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
Go!

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
Oh!

05:58.840 --> 06:00.940
Not that hard, stop!

06:00.940 --> 06:03.840
No!

06:03.840 --> 06:06.840
Get it out!

06:06.840 --> 06:10.840
Sweet taste!

06:10.840 --> 06:12.840
Don't chop it!

06:12.840 --> 06:14.840
When?

06:14.840 --> 06:17.840
Oh FTS!

06:17.840 --> 06:31.620
You know.

06:31.620 --> 06:35.140
What is that?

06:35.140 --> 06:37.100
No!

06:37.100 --> 06:39.100
No!

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
No!

06:40.100 --> 06:42.860
I'm all scared.

06:42.860 --> 06:43.860
Yes!

06:43.860 --> 06:44.860
Yes!

06:44.860 --> 06:45.860

06:52.860 --> 06:53.860

06:53.860 --> 06:54.860

07:00.860 --> 07:01.760
Oh...

07:01.760 --> 07:02.460
Aah!

07:02.460 --> 07:03.460
Aah!

07:03.460 --> 07:04.260
Aah!

07:04.260 --> 07:05.260

07:06.260 --> 07:06.760
Aah!

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
Aah!

07:07.760 --> 07:08.760
There's a sprite here!

07:08.760 --> 07:09.760
There's a sprite!

07:09.760 --> 07:10.260
Aah!

07:10.260 --> 07:11.260
Aah!

07:11.260 --> 07:11.760

07:12.760 --> 07:13.760
Aah!

07:13.760 --> 07:14.760
Aah!

07:14.760 --> 07:15.760
I don't want to hurt you!

07:15.760 --> 07:16.760
Just keep your distance!

07:16.760 --> 07:17.260
Aah!

07:17.260 --> 07:18.260
All right then!

07:18.260 --> 07:20.260
Eat salty little green faucets!

07:20.260 --> 07:21.260
Aah!

07:21.260 --> 07:22.260
Aah!

07:22.260 --> 07:22.760

07:22.760 --> 07:23.260
Aah!

07:23.260 --> 07:23.760
Aah!

07:23.760 --> 07:24.760
Aah!

07:24.760 --> 07:25.760
Aah!

07:25.760 --> 07:26.760
Aah!

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
Aah!

07:27.760 --> 07:28.760
Aah!

07:28.760 --> 07:29.760
Aah!

07:29.760 --> 07:30.760
Aah!

07:30.760 --> 07:52.140
Look!

07:52.140 --> 08:05.140
Those punks treated the world as her own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free.

08:05.140 --> 08:31.140
Now you'll join them.

08:35.140 --> 08:48.140
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

08:48.140 --> 08:55.140
All right, sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

08:55.140 --> 09:14.140
I'll give you that one.

09:14.140 --> 09:18.140
Danger danger, I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way.

09:18.140 --> 09:23.140
I'm about to blast this stick right plastic, what you're gonna say.

09:23.140 --> 09:27.140
I'm about to drop it, stanky, drop it, I'mma just catch and scream.

09:27.140 --> 09:41.140
Now pillage, and nude it, I'm a polluted lake to the river to the stream for spa.

09:41.140 --> 09:45.140
I'm a little deary, and call me cavalry, try to cut me down to size.

09:45.140 --> 09:50.140
Low of these, my announcer, driver, bouncer, bacon, make cakes and thighs.

09:50.140 --> 09:54.140
This camp is a colored, here come the fall out, me and my crew don't play.

09:54.140 --> 10:00.140
My boots on the log and the leaf on the frog cut, was in the tree, do you say hey hey?

10:00.140 --> 10:09.140
Take it to your own, take it to your own, take it to your own, take it to your own.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.140
You
