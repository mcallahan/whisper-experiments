00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hello, Mr. Snail!

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:21,080
Oh, you cute little corny wasperson, that name!

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Bonespoint!

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Ugh!

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,280
Can't believe we got stuck with the tree!

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,880
I'll start with a tree hugger.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,200
If I have to hear the Latin name for one more animal,

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
I swear I'm gonna kill her.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,360
Relax, sugar buns.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,520
While she does all the work, we'll have all the fun.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,440
Yeah, I get wasted out of our minds.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,160
Where are you, man?

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Come on, team, we mustn't dilly dally

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
when there's so much nature to see.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,160
I was thinking we should call our class project

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,720
fun guys in a forest.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,400
Get it?

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,600
Because we're a group of fun guys and also fun guys.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,840
Josh, nothing no right to you, and she's in distress.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,080
There are little monsters in a flower.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,440
Oh, look at her go.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,480
Wow.

23
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,920
Out of the way, talk, what?

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,440
We're camping here.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,480
Finally.

26
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,200
Time to get that barbecue burning.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh.

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Oh, oh, oh.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Oh.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Oh.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Oh.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Oh.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Oh.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Oh.

36
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh.

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
The ash.

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,040
Oh.

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Oh.

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,120
Oh, oh, ah.

41
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Hello.

42
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,240
Easy guys, we're supposed to be studying nature not

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,760
wrecking it.

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
Keys brake.

45
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
shaped.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,080
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

47
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Oh.

48
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Oi.

49
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Fungus free.

50
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,960
Make yourself useful and fix the tent.

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Oh.

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
I put a friendly campsite ribbing.

53
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,320
Fun.

54
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
US.

55
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,980
She went to five, five minutes alone in these woods.

56
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,980
Oh, yeah.

57
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,800
She's a real weeny that one in it.

58
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,020
Oi, Phil, I don't know sausage is coming.

59
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
Almost ready.

60
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,860
We're going to need a bit more salt.

61
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,700
Ugh.

62
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,540
Ugh.

63
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,860
Ugh.

64
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Huh?

65
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,860
Ugh.

66
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,860
Ugh.

67
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
Ugh.

68
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
Ugh.

69
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,860
Ugh.

70
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
Ugh.

71
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
Ugh.

72
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,860
It's so.

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:41,840
It's incredible, it's a new species.

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
What?

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
A bloody hell of those things.

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Be Frankie young, and we will stop to the day of fun

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Frankie, I am young, I am young

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
We do watch the day we run

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Frankie, we do

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Yeah! They're absolutely adorable!

81
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Yeah, absolutely bloody adorable!

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
And I bet we'll make a fortune if we catch one of those things.

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
We'd be famous!

84
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Get on MTV! I wonder what they taste like?

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
No, we really shouldn't disrupt their habitat.

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
Why? Sure, sure.

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Greetings!

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Welcome, friends! I'll be right down!

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Could I interest you in some peppermint tea?

90
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
What are you guys?

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
We are sprites! We sprite balanced to the forest!

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
We take care of the animals!

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Scratch!

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
What?

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Oh, geez!

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Oh, guys! Guys!

97
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Huh?

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Oh, this is a grass!

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Hey, uh, little mushroom geezer!

100
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
You call with us camping here for the night?

101
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Absolutely!

102
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,840
A friend of the forest is a friend of the sprites!

103
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Maybe, maybe it was just sketch up or something like red paint?

104
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Yeah, maybe they were just painting their little hats

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
or something.

106
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
Guys?

107
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Guys!

108
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Guys, this isn't funny!

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Guys?

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Yum yum yum!

111
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,840
You can catch me when we die!

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Three, three, go!

113
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Wait, we're just gonna catch one!

114
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
With their psycho!

115
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
You've gotta get me out of these hurrys!

116
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Say, can we kill us?

117
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,840
Three, three, go!

118
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Wait!

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
We've been stalling!

120
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,840
You picked the wrong camping spot, bitches!

121
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,840
Spray time!

122
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Oh!

123
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
It's like the rocks!

124
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
The rocks!

125
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
The rocks!

126
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,840
The rocks!

127
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
AHHHH!

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
AHHHH!

129
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
AHH!

130
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Hey!

131
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
AHH!

132
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
AHH!

133
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:41,840
Hey!

134
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
AHH!

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
AHH!

136
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
AHH!

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
AHH!

138
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
AHH!

139
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
AHHHH!

140
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
AHH!

141
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Go!

142
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Go!

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
Go!

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Go!

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Go!

146
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Go!

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Oh!

148
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,940
Not that hard, stop!

149
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,840
No!

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
Get it out!

151
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Sweet taste!

152
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Don't chop it!

153
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
When?

154
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,840
Oh FTS!

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:31,620
You know.

156
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,140
What is that?

157
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,100
No!

158
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
No!

159
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
No!

160
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm all scared.

161
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Yes!

162
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Yes!

163
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
No!

164
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
No!

165
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,860
No!

166
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
No!

167
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
No!

168
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
No!

169
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,860
No!

170
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
No!

171
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
No!

172
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
No!

173
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
No!

174
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
No!

175
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
No!

176
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
No!

177
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
No!

178
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
No!

179
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,760
Oh...

180
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,460
Aah!

181
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Aah!

182
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,260
Aah!

183
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,260
Aah!

184
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Aah!

185
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,760
Aah!

186
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Aah!

187
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
There's a sprite here!

188
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,760
There's a sprite!

189
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,260
Aah!

190
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Aah!

191
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,760
Aah!

192
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Aah!

193
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Aah!

194
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Aah!

195
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
I don't want to hurt you!

196
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Just keep your distance!

197
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,260
Aah!

198
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
All right then!

199
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Eat salty little green faucets!

200
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,260
Aah!

201
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Aah!

202
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:22,760
Aah!

203
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,260
Aah!

204
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,760
Aah!

205
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
Aah!

206
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,760
Aah!

207
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
Aah!

208
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Aah!

209
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Aah!

210
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Aah!

211
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
Aah!

212
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:52,140
Look!

213
00:07:52,140 --> 00:08:05,140
Those punks treated the world as her own personal rubbish bin, and you set them free.

214
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Now you'll join them.

215
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:48,140
I'll give you that one, brother bird.

216
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:55,140
All right, sprites, let's burn the bodies and have some peppermint tea.

217
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:14,140
I'll give you that one.

218
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Danger danger, I'm a forest ranger, about and clear the way.

219
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,140
I'm about to blast this stick right plastic, what you're gonna say.

220
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,140
I'm about to drop it, stanky, drop it, I'mma just catch and scream.

221
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:41,140
Now pillage, and nude it, I'm a polluted lake to the river to the stream for spa.

222
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,140
I'm a little deary, and call me cavalry, try to cut me down to size.

223
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Low of these, my announcer, driver, bouncer, bacon, make cakes and thighs.

224
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,140
This camp is a colored, here come the fall out, me and my crew don't play.

225
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,140
My boots on the log and the leaf on the frog cut, was in the tree, do you say hey hey?

226
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:09,140
Take it to your own, take it to your own, take it to your own, take it to your own.

227
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,140
You
